Hey! kissing noises

What are you doing? What are you doing?

Get that chewy! Eat—

Chew that chewy!

No, I don't want to!

I..

I don't want to chew it!

Look at this. You can see
the huge water, the huge lake...

and then you realize that you brought
your kids to a fuckin' shitty theme park...

and you look down at that, and you go,

old man voice Why did
we get in line for thi-

Yeah, that's not even—

That's not a big deal at all!

I don't know why that's making me laugh.

cool ride to a lame one.

Alright let's see; look at the g's.

Want me to help you?

Like, are you seriously all that stupid?

Now it's just deleting them.

Okay.

Well... bye.

Thanks for coming.

Good, I'm glad the highest
attraction in the whole park

is the clown bathroom.

People pay money to come
to the clown bathroom—

Look at this guy!

This guy deserves a raise!

Yep.

How do I give him more money?

$200 per month?

$204 now.

You got yourself a raise.

cartoony voice This one's for kids!

I'm going to even name it For kids,

so parents know that it's for kids!

cartoony voice
then it just runs the kids right into the ground!

You know, I play all kinds of stuff;
faux cool voice

I'm like a variety guy, I play like games...
faux cool voice

I playe—

Hey, I Beat Dark Souls 3.

Right? I did it on stream.

So, I mean if you were like—

If you came to this stream
and you're wondering like,

I fucking hate this guy,
because he sucks...

j— I...

You know, I beat Dark Souls 3 on stream.

You know—

You know anybody else that
ever did that in their life?

Mm...

I can't name very many...

No no, no you see, I beat Dark Souls!
faux impressive voice

Then he's— I'm okay.

I.. stammering

OHHH!

No! Wait what are you doing?!

laughing What happened?!

Oh god! Thank fucking god!

laughing Hey,
did I tell you I beat Dark Souls 3?

What about the last game I played?

What did I play last?

Beat Hitman on stream.

Ah...

I... d'you know...

Guess how many points I got?

How many points did the
guy got sic on that stream?

Answer is zero.

Zero.

Zero points

...on the Hitman stream.

I—I did... I completed each...

Did I—

You know, I beat Dark Souls though;
that doesn't matter.

You can d— you...

It doesn't matter what you say.

You can tell me that like
the Hitman playthrough,

I beat it, but like,
Oh, wow, you sucked.

I... pfff... beat Dark Souls
3 on stream in three days.

I have my gamer license;
I'm allowed to have it.

You can't take my license away from me;

I lost it when I played
Binding of Isaac like 4 years ago.

Got it back when I played Dark Souls 3
on stream in 3 days.

You know when a spider makes its web,
and you've seen the spider on drugs thing?

They started giving the
spider drugs right here.

And it was just like,

Jesus, I don't even
know where my web goes.

No fucking way.

No fucking way!

Are you guys looking
at the excitement meter?

This is going to be better
than the roller coaster.

You gotta be kidding me.

Look at that. When they get in the bump...

I swear to god...

laugh

This...

This ride's more fun
than the roller coaster...

This is gonna be scary...
we're going into the tunnel!

Here goes the first splash!

Ohhh... you can see the fire!

Ohhh...!

Wait, what is that?!

Is that a Dragon?!

Holy shit a dragon!

Woa—!

Dude, this is better
than fucking Disney World!

There's nowhere for me
to go! Oh no, help me!

That's not the face of Help me.

I'm stuck, help me!

I'm having so much fun being stuck!

Help!

Oh no, this is them—
This is them SAYING Help me!

I thought they were doing like a...
like a party!

This is like—

This is having a party!

This is not I'm stuck!

laughing
I thought they were like wicked happy to get off the ride!

Ok, so for times one speed; Help me,

Times two speed; YEAH!

This is sick!

Times three speed; This is like
the best place I've ever been to!

Times one speed; GOD HELP US!

Of all the things...

...in this stupid fucking park,
that have killed hundreds of people...

It's the little kitty cat ride.

This was supposed to
be a dumb ride for kids,

and it's killed 300 people.
