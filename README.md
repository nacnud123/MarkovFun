# MarkovFun
This is a project I did in my free time using Markov Chain and Python to generate random sentences based on an input corpus.
# Customization
If you want to add a new file or replace an image, cool with me.
To add a new input file simply add a new .txt file to the Funny folder.
If you want to add your own image replace Funny.png with any .png file you want. Also, rename that image to "Funny.png" (without quotes). You can't move the text placement or font size so keep that in mind.
To change the font, font size, and text location please edit the Python script.
