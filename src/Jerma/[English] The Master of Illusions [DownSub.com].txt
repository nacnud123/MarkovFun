 He's a freaky mind man 

 Jermafreak 

 Jerma, the freak,
the freakiest of the minds 

 If your mind's a freak, he'll prove it,
'cause he's Jermafreak 

 'Cause he's Jermafreak! 

 He's a freaky mind man,
he's a freaky mind boy 

 If he scares you with
his freaky mind powers 

 Well, guess what?
That was what he was trying to do 

 Freaky Jerma mind 
 Freak! 

 As a mind-freaker,
freak out you know 

 He did it 

 Jerma, the freak 

Freak out your mind!

And here we are.

The Master of Illusions is ready to begin.

Now when I was like 16,
I was a huge fan of magic.

Magic was like one of my
favorite things on earth.

I wanted to do it,
I wanted to be a magician,

I wanted to be a magic wand
maker when I was 16.

No, when I was like 10,
I wanted to be a magic wand maker.

chuckles

Hold on! I'm like getting a trick ready!

So any master magician will tell you

he needs a magic wand
to do most of his tricks.

So as we're gonna set up here,

the first couple of tricks are
gonna be just very easy things.

You can do it in your home with your…

with your friends and your parents…
bumps microphone

…and your mother and your father,
you can all be involved.

So I'm gonna make...

There's a little vase right here, I'm
not sure—it might be a little too dark.

You know, it might—
it is a little too dark.

Let me just see if anybody
texted me on my cell phone

before I brighten things up
just a little bit, what do you say?

magic sparkles

This is just—somebody's
calling me right now.

Yeah, I... I can't talk to you right now.
magic sparkles

I'm in the middle of doing magic tricks!

magic sparkles repeatedly

What do you think about that?

All right!

Let's keep going!

In this vase right here,

I'm gonna make something appear.

It's gonna be very, very interesting, and
you gotta say the magic words with me.

Anytime we do a trick,
you gotta say the magic words.

The magic words are
Presto Majesto, okay?

So, on the count of three, I want
everyone to say Presto Majesto, okay?

One, two, three.

Presto…
all Presto…

…Majesto!
…Majesto!

magic sparkles

And there it is, ladies and gentlemen!

Just like that, a flower in the vase!
applause

Can you believe it?
applause

Can you believe that?
applause

What a masterful display of magicinal…
applause

…magical displays I've seen.

And in my entire life,
that one was taught to me…

by my… fuckin'… sensei.

As you can see, eh, that's out.

See you later.

For my next trick…

we're gonna find out—now, we're gonna
find out what's in the mystery box.

We're gonna find out what's
in the mystery box, guys.

Regular box.

Not a big deal, as I'll show you.

Nothing in it, as you can see.

Can shake it around,
I can move it all over the—

doesn't matter, just a regular box.

That's it.

No big deal at all, but…

as we all know,

if you say the magic words…

If you say the magic
Presto Majesto words…

magic sparkles
Presto Majesto…

and there's candies.

Now there's candies.

applause

And just like that, Presto Majesto,
and guess what, they're gone again.

applause continues
They're gone.

Bang!
magic sparkles

Just like that again, candies.
applause

Hm.
applause

Interesting shit.
applause

applause

Regular deck of cards?

No… Nothing out of
the ordinary, I would say.

But, there is something
very strange about this.

I'm gonna be able to pick your card.

That's right, you watching right now,

I will get your card.

I'm gonna get it in one try.

So here we—if you know—

typically when you're on the street doing—
like I do magic on the street,

you need to tell me when to stop.

Okay? I'm gonna slowly—I'm gonna shuffle,
you gotta tell me when to stop.

So, go ahead, I'm gonna start—

I'm gonna stop for every
person that says stop.

Here we go.

Go.

various voices say Stop repeatedly
Huh.

Okay.
various voices say Stop repeatedly

Okay.

various voices say Stop repeatedly

Somebody said stop.
Please stop.

Stop.
various voices say Stop repeatedly

Stop again. Yup. Stop.
various voices say Stop repeatedly

Stop. Stop. Got it, yeah.
various voices say Stop repeatedly

STOOOP!
Stop.

various voices say Stop repeatedly
Okay.

Stop, stop there.
See, I'm—lot of stops here. Okay.

Lot of stops.
various voices say Stop repeatedly

Got you. I got your side, here's your side.
various voices say Stop repeatedly

Got ya, got ya, got ya, got ya.
Stop this, please!

Please stop.

various voices say Stop repeatedly
Yeah.

Stop this mindless violence!
Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

various voices say Stop repeatedly
Okay.

Oh dear God, stop it.
Stop.

various voices say Stop repeatedly
Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop.

STOP!
Stop. Stop, okay.

Now I'm going to shuffle up the deck now.

No—no trickery here. No trickery.

Gonna get this shuffled.

subscription notification
Wait, what?!

I'm not a good shuffler.

And I want someone to say
the magic words: Presto Majesto.

That was somebody's card.

applause

That was somebody's card in the chat.
Somebody's. I don't know who's.

It was one of your cards. Got it.

The next one…

Take a look at this black and white photo.

With a little Presto Majesto,

this black and white photo can turn
into something completely different.

I need my magic wand.

magic sparkles repeatedly

And there it is.

Ladies and gentlemen,
just to make sure…

just to make sure you don't think
I'm doing any bullshit here:

Lookit.

Up close.

It's just a black and white image.

applause

Or is it?! Huh?
applause stops

Or is it?

scattered applause

Anything fishy in here?

Nope.

picture thuds

Did that get stuck in the ceiling?

chuckles

And lookit, there's your card!

applause
magic sparkles

The next one requires a mystery box.

As you can see, mystery box.

subscription notification
Wait, what?!

I mean, I would open it,
but it's a mystery box,

so I don't wanna…
potentially fuck this up.

This is a shot of vodka.

It's going right in the bo—

I'm going to place it in the box
very, very easily, very carefully.

No big deal.

It's just in the box, right?

And with a tap of the wrist…

lone audience member claps
Okay.

Woo!

That one's done.

Here's my magical lunch box.

Inside my magical lunch box,

there is something very—this is the
best trick of the night, by the way.

Best fucking trick of the night.

So what I do

is I open…

Open…

One second.

This trick is a real fooler.

So give it some practice, and
you're going to have a lot of fun with it.

Let's take a look at how
the lunch box is made.

There's two sides that open, not just one.

The second side…

Okay…
…is able to hold the bottle right in place.

whispers
Okay…

Bottle just clicks right into the holder.

Now to perform the trick…

…this side starts towards you in the back.
Close it back up, okay.

You begin by holding the lunch box
up and then opening both sides.

whispers
Okay.

But you're going to open the back first.

Open the back and let it drop,
and then open the front.

When you do it in this…

Oh, all right, okay.

…the lunch box…

Okay.
…is completely empty.

Now what they don't know…

Okay.

I got my box here, ladies and gentlemen,
and inside the box is a, uh…

just a regular lunch box
I can take off both sides.

And…

didn't do it right.

Didn't do it right, that's okay.
applause

We don't need that anymore.

box drops
applause ceases

BUT the cool thing about this…!

This is my magic thermos.

The magic thermos is, uh…
a very, very interesting device.

The very interesting thing
about this device is this:

Inside, there's a small black hole
inside of the magic thermos,

which means that I can pour things
inside of it, and it might not necessarily…

it might not necessarily stay in there.

So here we have a cup of orange juice.

I will make sure it's not
poisoned just to prove it to you.

slurps

It's real.

So we're just simply going to pour it in.

See? No tricks.

It's just orange juice, right?

No big deal.

So now, it's in there.

You can very clearly tell.

And with the slap of the wand,

Presto Majesto… bang…
magic sparkles

where did it go?

Where did it go?

pours juice

snorts

Where did it go?!

Where did it go?

Why are you not working?

See?

Only a little bit came out!

applause

Not the whole thing!
applause

chuckles
applause

applause

Presto!

Yeah! Look! See?
The na—na—n—na—na—yeah!

White rabbit. Right?

Just a regular white rabbit.

Upside down, but a
white rabbit nonetheless.

Presto Majesto.

He's gone.

explosive crash

I wanna fucking throw this so bad.

I was just going to spike
this against the back wall.

Somebody else's card.

all Woo!

Right here, we've got…

two—two bottles, right?

Well, not two bottles, we have a glass.

We have a bottle.

Put them right there.

So, this can very easily fit over both.

Right? Just take a look here.
This is the glass.

Both can very easily fit.
As you see, they both fit very easily.

Now the trick—
the trick here is to find

potentially how we can…

maybe end up switching them around.

audience murmurs

Sometimes it takes a
little bit of your mind

spectator coughs
…to process what just happened…

and I can completely
understand that as we...

audience murmurs

Burn the witch!

audience murmurs

Presto Majesto!
applause

This is gonna be a pain in the ass to
clean up in like an hour, I promise you.

So my final trick of the evening…

There's one more.

Where did it go?

I don't know where it is.
chuckles

I don't know where the last trick is.

It's over.
