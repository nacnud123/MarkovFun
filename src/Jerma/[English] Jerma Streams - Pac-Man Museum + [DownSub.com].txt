Somebody said,
Who's your favorite Vocaloid?

I don't know.
I didn't know there was that many.

You done peeing? Yeah.

I am done peeing.

You guys ready for Pac-Man Museum?

I'm gonna turn it down,
hopefully it's not too loud.

I don't even know what this is.

We're about to find out.

Pac-Man theme plays Yep.

All right, let me capture this.

Max FPS.

No, that's fine.

Uhh... that's fine.

Borderless window? Yeah.

Okay it's very loud,
let me turn this down first.

I actually can't turn it down.

I have to go to the source here.

All right, let's get back.

You can't see it yet,
but you will in a minute.

I'm just putting it together.

Pac-Man...

Where are you?

There you are.

All right.

So let's go!

Loud overlapping Pac-Man sound effects

What are they doing?

What the fuck is going on?

Loud sound effects

All right.

Welcome to Pac-Man Museum Arcade.

In this arcade you can choose
coins to play a variety of Pac-Man—.

Oh shut them all—everybody shut up!

Welcome to Pac-Man Museum Plus.

In this arcade you can use coins
to play various Pac-Man games.

When you want to play a game
move in front of it and select play.

The game will start.

While in the arcade
press Y to open the menu.

Okay, okay.

Okay.

Okay.

This place is fucking annoying.

I wouldn't want to be in here
for more than five minutes.

All right what do they have for machines?

Gashapon?

Spend coins on the Gashapon to get—.

I don't know how you—.

Loud Pac-Man sound effects

Is this supposed to t—is it
supposed to sound like this?

I gotta get out of here.

All right, Pac-Man Pac-Mania.

Sighs

Huh?

Okay, I was gonna say I thought
it was gonna be that small?

Let's get a few extra lives.

Got it.

Laughing It sounds like Miku.

It does, this sounds like Miku.

I can't escape that game.

It really sounds like Miku.

I feel like my voice has
changed in the last hour.

Got him.

Come on! Come on!

Come on Gywn! Come on Gywn!

You can jump?

What? I didn't know you could jump.

I'm never gonna get
caught by a ghost ever again.

One.

Two.

Three.

Four.

Ooh!

You!

Oh we get a cutscene!

Jerma humming to the music

It's the best song—this is THE
best song they've ever made.

Jerma humming to the music

Jerma humming to the music

What the fuck was that double bounce?

Screen Settings?

Nah, I don't want CRT—I
want the bigger screen though.

But that's better.

Are you okay?
Yeah!

I wasn't looking.

I wasn't looking.

That's fine, all right? It doesn't matter.

I got four thou—I got four coins.

That's it?

I unlocked Pac-Mania cabinet,
a gold container a—Slap-like sound effect

Okay, you get the—Laughs

I got a cabinet.

Slap-like sound effect

Okay, that fucking stung.

Stop—stop hitting me. Stop slapping me.

This original Pac-Man?

Play in—play Pac-Man In Time two times.

Try to do the original?

Pac-Land.

What's Pac-Land?

How do you play Pac-Land?

Oh my god it's this fucking game.

To control Pac-Man run with the—in the
direction of the arrow. How do you jump?

I feel like I'm going max
speed in Oregon Trail.

Stop.

I did it?

Let's go!

God, I wanna play that Bugs
Bunny Smash Brothers game again.

So, is that thing down here a timer?

That's money.

Oh, that's such bullshit when that happens.
Absolute horseshit.

Just total horseshit.

Play MultiVersus again.
I can't, they turned it off.

The alpha's gone now, they closed it.

When's the release?
Uh, July, I think.

July's the open beta.

This game's awful.

All right, now what?

Super Pac-Man?

Background music changes to Pac-Man theme

At least it shuts up the people.

Okay, at least we can get
away from that fucking song.

Laughing Oh, there it is.

The one where you could
jump was really actually good.

Exclaims

Get him!

Exclaims

Singing song in a weird voice

Here it comes.

I fucked this whole thing up so bad.

Music that Jerma was previously singing

Let's go.

I tried to press up.
This game is fucking stupid.

Wait, what?
I didn't press it that many times!

Did you guys know that Pac-Man
was originally going to be a pizza game?

It was like you put like sauce and cheese on
the pizza and stuff and you put in the oven.

But the game director...

The s—putting the sauce on the pizza sound
sounded so funny to the director of the game.

That it just like We should probably—maybe we should change
it to like an eating thing where the pizza eats things.

Fucking idiots.

Y—lying comes so easily to you.

I'm not a liar, I'm a performer.

Shut up.

It—it's a performance, shut up.

I'm a performer.

This dude is wicked soy?

I'm fine.

That was fun.

Who—.

He was gonna be called Puck-Man.

No, it was Pizza-Man.

Play Pac-Man two times. Okay so I have to
play this two times to unlock Super Pac-Man?

All right I played it twice.

All right, come kill me.

They found out in the US kids would
edit the 'P' on the machine to an 'F'.

Jerma this sucks go back to Miku.

I can't, I'm too burnt out to do Miku.

I can't do Miku, I can't play Miku anymore.

I'm—I'm burnt out from
all the flashing colors.

Miku or riot.
No, I can't right now I'm too tired.

Now.

Look, I've got—I unlocked, um,
Pac-Man—Super Pac-Man.

There we go.

All right, what is Super Pac-Man?

Have I ever played this?

Stutters Is this the same one?

This looks fucking weird.

What the hell is this?

I—.

This is interesting.

Do I have to get all the keys?

Pac-Man would never eat
eggs they're too healthy.

Wait, he eats fruits.

Please, my ears.

It looks like it's turned down.

What the fuck, I got all the fruits.

It's all the keys?

This is the kind of game that I
would get for like my grandfather.

On his Steam—his first Steam account.

And I would go to check a year from now to see
what my grandfather had in his Steam library.

And it would be this, and, I don't know Dead Space 1
and 2 because it's on sale for three dollars every year.

It's the only games he would have.

And all the free to play stuff and you'd go on it
and see how much time that grandpa had play time.

He hadn't even opened 'em.

500 hours on Path of Exile.
Laughs

They go too fast.
I—I never was a fan of Pac-Man.

I was—I was never a fan of Pac-Man.

I was always—I was more of a fan of Pac-Man's
character than I was as video games.

Okay, there's Pac-Man,
Super Pac-Man, Pac-Mania.

Pac-Man Battle Royale?

Pac-Land, Pac-Man Arrangement?

And, Pac-Pal?

Okay,
let me—let me do Pac-Man Battle Royale.

Say it isn't so. I love Pac-Man, he's
the greatest video game character ever.

But his, I don't know,
his games were kind of...

The original is great.

Pac-Man's Great Adventure is great.

The one where you have to like
point him in directions and help him.

Why is that not here?

This one's good.

Okay.

Eat power pellets.

He's a cannibal.

Fight!

How do I—how do you win?

Wait, you don't—how do you hurt each other?

I don't understand what's going on.

Do I have to wait to eat each other?

Ahh, all right. That's all right.

So I've won.

Wait for next round?

This is zoomer Pac-Man.
No it's not.

Money in.

I guess if you played with
like four people it's fine.

But does everyone have
to have their own controller?

At the arcade cabinet that would be fun.

Kiss the CPU?
Laughs What?

Lost to CPU.

How come there's only one CPU?
That's weird.

Shouldn't there be way more?

That's—how did I just lose that?

Burger.

You only have one CPU in your computer.

You only have ONE CPU.

All right, this—this one sucks.

It—this would be fun with like
four actual friends sitting around.

This is a scuffed version
of Championship Edition.

They have these at ta—they have these at— I think
they have these as table machines in some arcades.

That makes sense.

I'm just fucking waltzing around,
I'm not even paying attention.

What just happened?

Why is the sound getting faster?

Chuckling This is a
Dave and Buster's game.

It really is.

Laughs

This is a game at Dave and Busters.

That's so funny.

Yeah, and it spits out, like, 10 tickets.

This shit—you're like Oh, great, cool. That
was fun I guess. I got like eight tickets.

This literally is at Dave and Busters.

No, is—is it actual— No it's not?

It actually is.
Deal or No Deal is the best arcade game.

That could be maybe—should I play Deal
no Deal on stream? I think that'd be fun.

All right, well that game was fun.
It's fine.

That's fine.

Loud.

My turn.

Play Pac-Land two times.
I—I want to know what Pac-Pal is, right?

Pac-Mania and Pac-Land.
Where's Pac-Land?

Okay, so I'm gonna open this and then
close it, cause what is—what is Pac-Pal?

Oh, it knows.

I have to actually get in and die.

Stammers This one
was actually the best one.

There's more games in the big machine.

What was the Pac-Man game you played
you made a video on like ten years ago?

That's Pac-Man 2...
the Great Adventure or something?

It's not a Pac-Man game.

It's a side-scrolling directions game,
it's really weird.

I wonder if there's
a—if they might be in it.

Mutters Oh my fucking god.

This one has a final boss. It's not in this—why
would this not—is it a licensing problem?

I thought that was going to be on here. That's
what I want, that's why I bought the game.

I thought it was a Pac-Man Museum Plus.
Okay, let's go.

Pac-in-Time?

That's one of them that I'm thinking of,
right?

Okay, well, what's Pac-Man Arrangement?

How did I not even know
these games came out?

Okay.

Instructions.

I mean I've been playing
video games for 30 years.

I feel like these were all made up today.

And I'm being gaslit into
thinking these are real.

I've never heard of these.

Why is there a bunny?

This one's actually fun.

I like this one.

This one's good.

Dash?

Whoa.

All right that's cool.

That was awesome.

It's kind of fun to do that.

Whoa, wait, you can do that?

That's helpful.

Pac-Man Arrangement.
That—what a weird name.

Is that why this game didn't do that well?
Because it's called Pac-Man Arrangement?

I thought it was gonna be—I thought I
was gonna be making flowers or something.

A painting game, I didn't think it was
gonna be an actual Pac-Man game.

Get them all! Good.

Go!

Uh oh, I'm in trouble.

Actually in trouble.

Nope, I'm good.

Why wouldn't it be a Pac-Man game?

I don't know, they've made some weird
ass Pac-Man games over the last 20 years.

That's a big fucking deal.

I missed one little pellet. Really?

Oohh.

Got it.

They make a weird noise,
the ones that they go ooh!

Exclaims Fuck.

You should have a Pac-Man themed wedding.

I thought—wait I thought that was it.
I thought this was a bonus stage.

What the fuck?

Throwing for Pac-content.

It is a bonus round.

Okay that was I—I don't know why I just got
invincibility frames for a second. That was weird.

Shit! Bad.

What?! I swear this fucking
goddamn controller, what the hell.

Oh no.

I'm pressing the buttons!

What the fuck?!

I'm pressing down—it's just these
fucking hits of wall freezes bro.

Bro! Relax.

All right, that was fun.

I—I'm literally pressing the button,
it just hits the wall and move.

This is why Pac-Man only works when you have
the stick that has only the four directions.

Anything else is impossible.

You cannot play Pac-Man
with a regular fucking controller.

You have to have four—one,
two, three, four. That's it.

Return to arcade? Yes, please.

Use the D-pad.
D-pad doesn't work either.

Because sometimes you press up on a D-pad it
presses like left or right at the same time.

I'm using an Xbox One controller.

The D-pad is like all one gigantic button.

You need a stick. Or arrow keys.

Yeah, but I'm a fucking console gamer.

Okay now what is up with this?

Play Pac-Land two times.
Where's Pac-Land?

Okay. How have I not played
this—I already did play this once.

Continue from pause date?

Oh, I just got sick of it,
I didn't want to play anymore.

Play Deal or no Deal.
We'll do that on, um, on Sunday.

Here's your plan for Sunday: we're
gonna play—we're gonna play um...

Trivia and, um, game show games.

How about Who Wants to be a Millionaire,
Deal or no Deal.

Some—maybe a couple of others.

We'll do that on Sunday.

I'm just trying to die.

All right, now back out, come back in.

I want to at least see each game once.

Play the awful full-priced millionaire
game that came out like a year ago.

Yeah that's probably the one I'll play.

Go buy more games.

Let me unlock these ones first.

What about the Oregon Trail?

I don't—I think I have maybe once,
back during one of the DOS nights maybe?

I think so.

Okay.

Mutters Oh my fucking god dude, really?

I just played it again.

All right, let me be honest.

I bought the fucking game.

Do I have to really—do you have
to put all this shit under walls?

Like, it's Pac-Man Museum.

Do I really have to do all this
to play the Pac-Man games I want to play?

It's not a—it's a museum. It's Stammers.

I don't have to go look at the Mona Lisa to
unlock the other fucking paintings in the museum.

If it's a museum just put it in the museum.
Just put it in the museum!

Hey, just put it—put it for
display in the museum!

Unlocking things is fun you
joyless husk of a human. Chuckles

Okay, can I please play the other game?

I got it.

Pac and Pal.

Eat the—turn over the card
and eat the flashing item.

Reading the comic Give it back!
I'm good. She's safe.

Touch a ghost and you'll lose.

Turn the tables with a special item.

Press the button.

This like kind of hurts my head to look at.

Eat the 'S'?

We did it.

The one with the hat was better.

I get the idea,
the concept is interesting, right? But I—.

It's just modded Pac-Man.

It's pretty awful.

I'd say it's very awful.

It's a less fun Pac-Man.

Okay,
so what—are there any others I can do?

This one: Play Pac-in-Time two times.

Where's Pac-in-Time?

Do I have to buy it?

Where do I get it?

How do I get, um, Pac-in-Time?

It's the big one.

What big one? I can't play it.

Pause-saving is not supported.

Oh, what the fuck?

Our hero Pac-Man is the cool
video game dude we know and love.

Okay.

When the evil Ghost Witch and her ghost monsters
invaded his world, Pac-Man was there to defend it.

Since then he's been living
happily with his family in Pac-Land.

But his fiendish arch enemy, the Ghost Witch,
has vowed to disrupt his tranquil life.

Okay.

Following the failure of her diabolical plans,
she decided to eliminate Pac-Man once and for all.

The Ghost Witch cast a forbidden—Laughs—forbidden
spell on Pac-Man, ripping him from his family.

Oh my god.

And hurling him through
time to his dangerous past.

The journey back in time transformed
Pac-Man into a young Pac-Boy.

And the only change is he
doesn't have a nose anymore.

The Ghost Witch sent him to a world
which has never heard of the hero Pac-Man.

Through the Witch's foul magic, the inhabitants
of a once beautiful land have turned against him.

And the Ghost Witch's loyal ghosts will do
everything possible to keep him prisoner.

Look at how cute he is!

I love this version of Pac-Man.
He's so cute.

Let's find out.

Okay.

Mountain.

My eye.

Um, huh? You have a—.

This is like Mega Man.

Are they trying to make—okay, the shoes, the fast running,
they just tried to make a Sonic the Hedgehog version.

What does that do?

Jerma humming along to the beat

He's so stumpy.

How do I open this?

How do I open the chest?

He looks like one of those custom South
Park characters that everybody used to have.

Do you remember that?

Can I swim?

You need a key. Oh.

I can't swim.

Fruit!

Anytime I see somebody playing Mega Man that knows
what they're doing and they're really good at the game.

Some of the speed runners, right?
It's always like—Mashing buttons

They just like Brrr! Brrr! Brrr!

When they jump it's crazy.

How do I get through here?

Can I swim?

I can't swim down.

Use the item?

What item?

A?

Change— Oh, left bumper.

Laughs

Somebody just said this sucks.

How do I get down here?

How do I break this?

Look, can I drop down?
You need a hammer?

Press 'a'.

Is there another item?

These controls are gonna—.

Okay.

Slow down, slow down.

Get the water hammer?

Where is it?

This is worse than Glover. No it's not.

Where's this hammer?

It's in the water? What?

Get me out of here.

How do I get in the fucking exit?

You need all the rings?

All the dots.

I can't even get back up here!
Guys I'm fucking screwed.

I can't beat the level anymore.

Where's the rope?

Why did the rope get taken from me?

Somebody said reviewer gameplay.
Oh, please.

You don't know how hard this is to control.
It's so weird.

Ow.

Ouch.

It's really weird.

Okay, I think they're up here.

He's so bouncy it's—it's strange trust me.

I'm so impatient. I fucking can't do it.

Got it.

Yawns

That was fun.
I don't want to do that anymore.

That was a really cute one,
but I don't want to do that.

Pac 'n Roll Remix.

Okay.

Is it GameCube or something?

Is he yelling?

This is another Dave and Buster's game.

I don't—I disagree.

Check!

Checkpoint.

Get up there!

Get up there.

They're driving me fucking crazy.

Get me the fuck outta here.

It's just you—Mimics bumping into objects

Like you can't control it—it's just he's so bouncy,
he's so bouncy in these games it's ridiculous.

But I have to play this again.

He goes too fast and he's too bouncy.

I feel like my mouse
sensitivity is too high.

Games like these just
drive me fucking crazy.

I remember when I was a
little kid Snake Rattle and Roll.

I—I tried to break the
Nintendo controller in half.

Like, bending it this way because
I couldn't—I hated it so much.

Laughing And all it did was just
made really loud crackling sounds.

Like I was not strong enough to break it obviously
so it was just like Makes cracking sounds

I was—all you heard was
just crunching sounds.

Not strong enough to break it,
but strong enough to like kinda fuck it up.

Just get me out of here,
I don't want to play this.

Snake Rattle and Roll is good
you're just bad. No I—I didn't say that.

Pac-Man 256. What is this?

What the fuck?

Is it a mobile game?

I just kept hearing a guy laughing.

I just hear Laughter.

I want to do it again.

What is this fucking horseshit
and why are you so fast?

That's pretty cool.

What the fuck?

All right, one more.

One more, and that's it.

This is the best one so far.

I need to get a thousand.
I want to get over a thousand again.

Move!

Two thousand—twenty
five hundred and I'm done.

Uh oh.

Five thousand and I'm outta here.

Oh shit!

Noo!

That was bullshit.

More tuber reactions? Yeah.

All right 5K that's it.
I promise that's it. 5K and I'm out.

Is this on iPad?

Can I get this on iPad?

Times five!

How do you get the multiplier higher?

Fucking—what are you doing?! Do something!

What the fuck?!

What the hell was that?

It's—you gotta get the fruits. All right.

Let me see if I can get 10K.

All right, times two.

The coins don't matter that much.

I gotta get fruits.

Cherry!

Times four! Come on, come on,
come on, come on, come on!

Times six.

This is gonna be 6K.

Go!

Gasps

Gasps

No! Oh no!

Five thousand points! Please!

Do I get anything from doing it?

Do I—I don't get anything? Oh my god.

Fuck.

Oh, I'm addicted to this stupid game.

Get out of the fucking way.

Oh my god. Sings Pac-Man song

What does that stuff do?

I don't think—I've never touched it.

Oh no.

Oh no, oh no, oh no, oh no, oh no.

Muffled scream

Which way was he going? Oh my god.

Fucking damn it I—.

Your mic is fucked up.
I'm gonna fucking break it.

Oh, come on.

I have to get 5K or I've
refused to turn the stream off.

I am not turning this stream off till
I get 5000 points in Pac-Man 200.

That's a fact.

Why did that blow up?

Don't even. Don't even. Don't even.

What are you doing?!

Oh my fucking god, Jeremy.

You had so many—quiet.

You're moving too slow.

Find me a path I can go. Find me one path.

Every path is blocked.
Find me a single path I could go down.

Which path?

Blocked. Blocked. Blocked.
Blocked. Blocked. Blocked.

I didn't get that fucking thing?

I have to stop doing that.

I need to build up a multiplier.

No, no, no, no, no!

Use the shop?

Where's the shop?

Power-ups.

Collect coins to upgrade your power.

Oh, I can upgrade?

Add it to your loadout?

Upgrade to level one.

We're gonna be here all night.

Okay.

I don't like the freeze.

That's kind of annoying.

Okay.

Let's go.

How do I activate one of them?

Can I actually just use one?

How do I use that?

Oh, that's just what appears, I get it.
okay.

I got way too greedy.

Unequip the freeze?

Yeah it kind of sucks doesn't it?

How do I take it off?

Oh, okay.

That's much better.

Let's go.

Yeah right.

Yeah right.

You stink. It's fine.

I just need five—I need 5K.

Big points coming up here.

Tornado!

No no no!

That—why was he chasing me
over here I know what—Groans

I fucking hate this.

Stutters I love this game but I hate it at
the same time. I just want 5K and I'm done.

You just fucked with me.

Why are there so many
ghosts in the early game here?

Get outta here.

I didn't trust it.

You motherfucker!

Oh!

Come on run into me please,
please run into me!

I've gotta get you!

Got it.

I picked up the fucking thing! I went
over one of the pellets why did they not—.

I don't understand. I picked up a pellet.

I'm done.

That was fun.

That's the best one so far.

That's actually the best one so far.

'Orange always goes down.

Really?

I feel like I should have
gotten some points for that.

Pac-in-Time two times.

Pac-Man Arrangement.

I'll do this one and then I'm done.

I'll play this once and
then the stream's over.

This one is actually really fun isn't it?

Yeah,
this is just the other one but better.

The last two have been way more fun.

Yikes.

Didn't want to pick that up.

Wow!

Dude, the fucking analog stick just—.

That fucking goddamn controller.
Give me the arrow keys instead.

That was very greedy!

My fucking fingers! I need a stick.

I need a stick so bad.

I need a stick!

One—116 thousand.

200,000 points.

I think I could go for it. All right,
one more go, one more go. Last one.

Five minutes, let's go. Arrow keys,
I'm going for it. I'm going for 200,000.

Risky!

What—who are you? What the fuck was that?

Oh my fucking god dude, fuck that.

Unlucky.

Gasps

I pressed the wrong fucking button.

Blegh!

I couldn't touch it! I—I'm seriously
so pissed. I need a fucking stick.

It's impossible without a stick.

Exclaims

220.

That's so fucking fun.

Sighs What a fun game.

I can't do it.

That's so good.

Oh, that was fun.

All right.

I think that's it.

I'll see you guys—I've been speech
jamming myself the whole time.

I'll see you guys on Sunday,
that's gonna be it.

We're gonna do some Who Wants to be a
Millionaire, we'll do—what's wrong with my voice?

Who Wants to be a Million—.

Talking about the background Pac-Man theme I just
can't listen to it Stammers it's making me talk weird.

Okay.

Who Wants to be a Millionaire.

Deal or no Deal.

Maybe some Wheel of Fortune
or something? I'll get a bunch.

So I'll see you guys Sunday—Sunday at...

I'll try to be here at 3:00 again.
3:00 Pacific.

Let's see if I can pull it back to 3:00.

That was a lot of fun.

MultiVersus—I actually cannot wait to play
more of that when it comes out in July.

I want to keep practicing with Bugs.

You can just let me play the practice mode.

That's kinda loud.

Uh, thanks for joining me though.
I'll see you guys in a couple days.

Goodbye.

If we see you again, we see you again.

Those last two Pac-Man games, man.
I wish I played those first.

The seamless co-op mod for
Elden Ring just came out today.

I'll have to look into that.
I'm very curious about it.

You should play more Miku?

That—I've had a good time.

MultiVersus was really fun,
Miku was really fun.

These last few Pac-Man
games have been really fun.

I'm gonna be so—I really want
to play that MultiVersus right now.

Just off stream.

Damn. Okay.

I'll see you guys Sunday,
take care of yourselves. Call your mother.

You should do Miku Mondays.

Nah.

I promise the next time you hear
me scream it will not be distorted.

I'm gonna get that audio fixed by Sunday.

I promise.

I will get it sorted.

He's not going to fix
it he always lies to us.

What's this new face?

Laughs

That's so stupid.

All right, good night guys.
I'll see you later.
